#values is a numeric vector representing the time series data. The start parameter specifies the starting time, and frequency indicates the number of observations per unit of time (e.g., 12 for monthly data). The resulting ts_object is a time series object.

#You can also create a time series object from a data frame with a time column using the ts() function or use specific time series classes like zoo or xts for more advanced time series manipulation.
