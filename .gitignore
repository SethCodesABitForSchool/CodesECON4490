#the df didnt have date, ts function auto changed the dataset into a time series - i could be wrong 

# The ylim argument in the barplot function sets the limits for the y-axis, determining the range of values to display.
In the context of autocorrelation functions (ACF), the values typically range from -1 to 1, 
as autocorrelation coefficients can take values between -1 and 1.

#However, depending on your specific use case and the characteristics of your autocorrelation function, 
you might want to adjust the ylim values to better suit the range of autocorrelation coefficients you're observing. 
For example, if your autocorrelation coefficients mostly fall within the range of, say, -0.5 to 0.5, you can adjust 
ylim = c(-0.5, 0.5).
